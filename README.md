A package that enables interpolation of template strings with the output of embedded python code, 
in a way similar to the echo command in PHP.

It also defines some classes for dealing with user interaction. These classes can generate HTML
form elements for the template and also generate 'answer data' - essentially this is metadata associated to the template that can be used 
to grade end user input.

This package is meant to be used as the core of a Python based e-assessment system
